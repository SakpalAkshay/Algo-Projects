**Overview**

Developed an optimal delivery route system for finding the shortest route between multiple locations. This project uses algorithms like Nearest Neighbor, Brute Force algorithm and Minimum Spanning Tree to solve the problem.

I have utilized the Google Maps API to calculate distances between routes and display them on the frontend. The user can add the locations and has the option to select any one of the three algorithms and get the route as the output.



**Usage**

To run the project, use the following command: npm start

**Algorithms**

This project uses several routing algorithms, implemented in routing_algorithms.js. Here's a brief overview of each:

Nearest Neighbor

Brute Force

Minimum Spanning Tree

**Getting Your API Key**

To use the Google Maps API features, you will need to obtain your own API key from the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps to get your API key:

Visit the Google Cloud Console.

Create a new project or select an existing one.

Navigate to the "APIs & Services" dashboard.

Click on “Enable APIs and Services” and enable the Google Maps API for your project.

Go to the “Credentials” page and click “Create Credentials” to generate a new API key.

Once you have your API key, replace the apiKey variable in the test-app/src/App.js file.
